## Why Did You Build It?

As developers, we get excited to think about challenging problems. When you ask us what
we are working on, our eyes light up like children in a candy store. So why is it that
so many of our developer and software origin stories are not told? How did we get
to where we are today, and what did we learn along the way? This podcast
aims to look "Behind the Scenes of Tech's Passion Projects and People." 
We want to know your developer story, what you have built, and why. 
We are an inclusive community - whatever kind of institution or country you hail
from, if you are passionate about software and technology you are welcome!
