## Why Did You Build It?

As developers, we get excited to think about challenging problems. When you ask us what
we are working on, our eyes light up like children in a candy store. So why is it that
so many of our software origin stories are not told? This podcast
aims to look "Behind the Scenes of Tech's Passion Projects." We want to know
What you built, Why you built it, and for who it was for. We are an inclusive
and welcoming community - whatever kind of institution or country you hail
from, if you are passionate about software and technology you are welcome
in this community.
