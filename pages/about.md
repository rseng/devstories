As developers, we get excited to think about challenging problems. When you ask us what
we are working on, our eyes light up like children in a candy store. So why is it that
so many of our software origin stories are not told? This podcast
aims to look "Behind the Scenes of Tech's Passion Projects." We want to know
What you built, Why you built it, and for who it was for. We are an inclusive
and welcoming community - whatever kind of institution or country you hail
from, if you are passionate about software and technology you are welcome
in this community. Our logo is a tree with a single root, which represents
a "first commit" or the birth of an idea and subsequent growth and change into
a developed project, often with twists, turns, and interesting learnings along
the way.

## An Early Effort about People

This podcast was originally created as the Research Software Engineer Stories podcast,
which lasted from 2019 through 2022, with a last episode in August of 2022. The podcast
had an initial goal to spread awareness for the RSE role, which by the end of 2022 had
successfully done that, and had run its course The creator @vsoch decided to extend the spirit for 
excitement for development to a move diverse and inclusive community. It was then 
that the more scoped RSE Stories was extended to Development Stories ("devstories"),
and taking on two new, excited hosts for a new journey! The original site can be found
on the (now archived) master branch of the <a href="https://github.com/rseng/devstories" target="_blank">repository</a>
serving this site.
