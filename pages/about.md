As developers, we get excited to think about challenging problems. When you ask us what
we are working on, our eyes light up like children in a candy store. So why is it that
so many of our developer and software origin stories are not told? How did we get
to where we are today, and what did we learn along the way? This podcast
aims to look "Behind the Scenes of Tech's Passion Projects and People." 
We want to know your developer story, what you have built, and why. 
We are an inclusive community - whatever kind of institution or country you hail
from, if you are passionate about software and technology you are welcome! 
Our logo is a tree with a single root, which represents
a "first commit" or the birth of an idea and subsequent growth and change into
a developed project, often with twists, turns, and interesting learnings along
the way.

## An Early Effort about People

This podcast was originally created as the Research Software Engineer Stories podcast,
which lasted from 2019 through 2022, with a last episode in August of 2022. The podcast
had an initial goal to spread awareness for the RSE role, which by the end of 2022 had
successfully done that, and had run its course The creator @vsoch decided to extend the spirit for 
excitement for development to a move diverse and inclusive community. It was then 
that the more scoped RSE Stories was extended to Developer Stories ("devstories"),
and is opened up to take on interested, excited new hosts for a new journey! The original site can be found
on the (now archived) master branch of the <a href="https://github.com/rseng/devstories" target="_blank">repository</a>
serving this site. Want to host an episode? Be on the show? Get in touch!
