# Developer Stories Podcast

This podcast asks the question:

> Why did you build it?

And looks "Behind the Scenes of Tech's Passion Projects and People!" This means we want 
to know your developer story, and what you are building and why. By way of sharing
our software and stories, not only can we learn from one another, but we can
also create greater awareness for all the projects underway, and better collaborate
on technologies we are excited about.
