In this 91st episode we talk with the benevolent dictator and creator of Snakemake Johannes K√∂ster, who not only continues to be a leader in the bioinformatics community for software, but also is Group leader in Computer Science and Bioinformatics at the University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany, and is the founder of BioConda and several well-known Rust and community bioinformatics software that you likely know. In this episode we hear the founding story of Snakemake and how Johannes sees his role changing, the Snakemake software changing, and exciting changes coming with Snakemake 8! üêçÔ∏è How often do we refactor code as developers? How do we think (or work) through a design process? What are good strategies for publishing research software, and over a long period of time? Have you heard of F1000 Research? Listen to this week's episode to find out!
