In this 91st episode we talk with the benevolent dictator and creator of Snakemake Johannes K√∂ster, who not only continues to be a leader in the bioinformatics community for software,
but also is Group leader in Computer Science and Bioinformatics at the University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany. In this episode we hear the founding story of Snakemake and how Johannes sees
his role changing, the Snakemake software changing, and exciting changes coming with Snakemake 8! üêçÔ∏è How often do we refactor code as developers?
