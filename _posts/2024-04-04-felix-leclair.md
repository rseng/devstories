Today on Developer Stories I talk with Felix LeClair, an open source developer and BLAS Floating-point guru that works at Environment and Climate Change Canada. Felix is someone to watch - I have never met someone with as much passion about hardware and chip design as him. In this episode, we talk briefly about the history of HPC Social, the growing place to talk with your friends that are also HPC practitioners, and then delve into chips and precision. Is science in trouble with the move toward lower precision chips for the AI/ML use case? Felix has some interesting insights that you might want to hear. This episode was immensely fun to record, Felix is a fanastic human, and I hope that you enjoy listening!
