In this second episode, Tyler has graduated, and tells the story from when he first started dipping his toes into Life Sciences Consulting to where he is today. If you think this is a trivial matter of changing an office, think again! Tyler moved from California to Germany, faced a new culture and the challenge of forming new routines and relationships, and learned a ton along the way about life, writing, consulting, and biology. If you enjoyed our [first episode from last month](https://rseng.github.io/devstories/2023/tyler-burns-part-1/) you will definitely enjoy this genuine and introspective story of self-reflection and growth.
