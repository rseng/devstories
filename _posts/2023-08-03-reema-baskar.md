This is our third (and final) interview for the Life Sciences Consulting mini-series, and we are finishing with a bang! Today we talk to Reema Baskar, Postdoctoral researcher at 
the Genome Institute of Singapore. Reema is studying Systems Epigenetics and Immunology, with an intention to explore the business side. We talk about the process of learning about the enterprise of science as students, grit, and how seeing this perspective can help set goals for the future. We have so much fun in this episode - talking about cellular plasticity and epigenetics via the story of Sally the Cell.
