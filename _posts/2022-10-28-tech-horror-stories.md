In tech, we all can tell a horror story. It's when you accidentally ran a command,
didn't back something up (and lost it), or *scream* had your Zoom audio on when
you were singing to Avril Lavigne (anyone else?) So this week, and for the first
inagual episode of the newly rebranded "Developer Stories" we are sharing some of
these horror stories in this Halloween special episode!

Happy Halloween listeners! 🐈‍⬛💀🎃👻🥘🪦👿☠️
