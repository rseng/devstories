In this pre-SC "Supercomputing 24" episode, we talk to a leading voice from our community - "HPC Dan" or Dan Reed, Professor emeritus of the University of Utah after a great career that spanned academia and industry at Microsoft. We cover life experiences such as moving being academia and HPC, having impact, and how to think about the resource shortages that are resulting from the AI boom. We have interesting discussion on policy, how to get involved, and collaborations. If you haven't seen [Dan's Blog "Reed's Ruminations"](https://www.hpcdan.org/) it has lovely posts that cover stories of Dan's family to his (strong) opinions about [fruit cake](https://www.hpcdan.org/reeds_ruminations/2010/12/dreams-of-a-final-theory-the-origin-of-fruitcake.html).
