Today we invite Eric Haas on the show - our second guest in the Life Sciences Consulting mini-series. Eric got his BS in Biology from Davidson College, and has taken his journey from there to being founder and CEO of Ionic Cytometry Solutions. In this episode we talk about football, flow cytometry, and Eric's journey from learning about a technology to loving it, and putting together his own business. And did you know that honeysuckle is an unwielding beast that can take over a forest? Me neither! And it's surprising and hilarious. If you are business-minded or considering life sciences consulting, you will be interested to learn about Eric's background, path, and expertise. We hope you enjoy the show!
