For this 89th episode we are shifting from Life Sciences consulting to BioSciences software and workflows! I'm so excited this week to introduce you to Paolo Di Tommaso - the creator of the Nextflow workflow software, and CTO and Co-founder of Seqera Labs. Do you know how Nextflow came to be? Or why it's in Groovy? Or what cool work Seqera labs is cooking up? We have a fun chat in this epsiode, talking about everything from Converged Computing and Kubernetes to storage and filesystems, multi-tenancy, and you should definitely take a listen!
