Happy New Year listeners! We are kicking off 2024 with an episode on package management and snakes, but not just any package manager - we chat with Wolf Vollprecht, Founder & CEO of prefix.dev, who has been involved in projects ranging from conda (and conda-forge) to mamba and other QuantStack projects. If you haven't tried out their package manager [pixi](https://pixi.sh/) yet, I'm hugely enjoying it for the modern feel and speed and highly recommend giving it a whirl. And I'd keep a look out for this company - they develop in Rust and are doing some really cool work, and we can expect more exciting things to come in the future!
