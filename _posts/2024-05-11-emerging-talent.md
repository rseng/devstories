I recently spoke with Jay Lofstead about the challenges of starting a career in HPC, and this morning listened to a panel on "Emerging Talent in HPC." I found the panel was missing a valuable perspective, and wanted to make a quick recording of that perspective. This isn't an official Developer Stories episode, but rather some associated ramblings of a dinosaur, and ideas or thoughts that I think are useful to say.
