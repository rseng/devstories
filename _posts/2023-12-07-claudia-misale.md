It's a joy to introduce my colleague and friend, Claudia Misale, a Researcher at the IBM Watson Research Center. Claudia has a background in distributed computing and programming, and got her PhD Informatics from the Universit√† degli Studi di Torino in Italy. In this episode, we first go back to the Middle Age of computing (when there were floppy disks!) and talk quite a bit about gaming and then dive into MPI, the Message Passing Interface and Converged Computing. Also, it might be the case that her cat is a jiu-jitsu master. Just saying. You will need to listen to the episode to find out!
