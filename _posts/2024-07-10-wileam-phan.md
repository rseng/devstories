Today we chat with Wileam Phan, a performance engineer that first encountered high performance computing in Indonesia during his senior year, and has followed his interest through today and working on the performance tool HPCToolkit. In this episode, we talk about different strategies for performance analysis, the Exascale computing project, culture in the United States, and a little about open source.
