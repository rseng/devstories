In this episode, I interview Informatics Honors Students from Stellenbosch University, including Megan Stock, 
Nina and Renee Roux, and their fearless mentor Kim Martin about their work to create organization and structure
around the space of research software engineering work and roles. We don't just talk about these strange
things called ontologies, but we frame it in an ice cream metaphor, and have a lot of fun talking about programming
languages, desserts, and ideas for the future.

This is also a really fun episode because it is the first group interview on the podcast, and between the lines
of the story is about falling in love with a new type of work, and learning more about the self.
We hope that you enjoy this episode - happy Februrary listeners!
