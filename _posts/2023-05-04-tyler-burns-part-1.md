This episode kicks off the first in our Life Sciences consulting mini-series. We interview Tyler Burns, CEO and Founder at Burns Life Sciences Consulting. Tyler and I go way back to graduate school, and it was an amazing opportunity to hear his story about learning, life, and a discovery for a love of programming and solving interesting problems. Part I in this episode will cover Tyler's student and learning experiences, and look out for episode 2 that dives into Tyler's career as a Life Sciences consultant in Berlin coming your way next month!
