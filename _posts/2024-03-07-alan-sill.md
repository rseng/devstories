I'm thrilled to be interviewing Alan Sill, Managing Director, of the High Performance Computing Center at Texas Tech University, President of the Open Grid Forum, Co-Director of the National Science Foundation Cloud and Autonomic Computing Center, and my co-founder for HPC Social. Alan is someone that I could sit down with and listen to stories for hours, and that's reflected in this episode - we talk for over an hour on his start in Physics to exploration of high performance computing and impact that "still doesn't get him a discount at Starbucks." This is a great episode to capture a community member with both deep impact and broad experience, and for wisdom about leadership through technical excellence and social components. I hope that you enjoy it!
