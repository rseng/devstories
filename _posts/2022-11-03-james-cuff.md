Dr. James Cuff is the new inagural Executive Director of the MIT Office of Research Computing and Data (ORCD),
and he brings a rich history of leadership in the high performance computing that he's excited to share!
How does one pursue this path? There is a lot of stumbling, making mistakes, radical candor, and learning about yourself
and people. In this episode, James shares his story, starting from across the pond, and ultimately ending up in an area that
he loves, Boston, to be an HPC cowboy for the next generation of scientific computing!
