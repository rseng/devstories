It's a joy to write and share the Halloween special episode each year, and this year we take an adventure into a futuristic city, where corruption has overtaken and even science does not have a voice. We follow our protagonists through a dangerous city, battling night creatures and enjoying small moments of joy. Do you think it's corny? Well no worries, we have candy for that! And I'll leave it at that - Happy October and I hope you enjoy the episode!
