Jakob Luettgau is a researcher at the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation at Inria, with an interest in storage, workflows, and machine learning, amongst other things. In this episode, we talk about different patterns of I/O, storage for cloud and high performance computing, and more general ideas about the convergence between the spaces. We hope that you enjoy the episode, and happy summer listeners! üåûÔ∏è
