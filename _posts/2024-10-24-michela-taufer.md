Today we talk to Michela Taufer, Dongarra Professor of High Performance Computing at the University of Tennessee Knoxville. Michela leads the Global Computing Laboratory, and you've probably seen her on the stage of ISC and several high performance computing events! It was great to talk to Michela to get her perspective on leading a laboratory, democratizing access to science, and interesting work going on in our community.
